Part twisted entertainment, part government intimidation tactic, the Hunger Games are a nationally televised event in which “Tributes” must fight with one another until one survivor remains.  Pitted against highly-trained Tributes who have prepared for these Games their entire lives, Katniss is forced to rely upon her sharp instincts as well as the mentorship of drunken former victor Haymitch Abernathy.  If she’s ever to return home to District 12, Katniss must make impossible choices in the arena that weigh survival against humanity and life against love. The world will be watching.\n                Genre: Science Fiction, Adventure, Fantasy\n                Language: en\n                Rating: 7.2/10 from 18944 votes"

When the tyrannical ruler Stalin dies, his hapless inner circle scrambles to come up with the next evolution of the revolution ? but it's clear everyone is really out for themselves. Written and directed by Emmy® Award winning and Oscar® nominated Armando Iannucci, Rolling Stone calls the film a brilliant satire from a crack ensemble (including Emmy® and Golden Globe® winner Steve Buscemi, Simon Russell Beale, Andrea Riseborough and Michael Palin).
